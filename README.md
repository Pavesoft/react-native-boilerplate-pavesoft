This boilerplate provides a robust starting point for React Native development, pre-configured with essential libraries and a structured folder layout. Designed to streamline your development process, this template integrates key tools and practices to help you build high-quality mobile applications efficiently.

 It includes a bottom tab navigator and five sample dummy pages to help you get started quickly with navigation and screen management.

## Features

- **Expo Integration**: Leverage the power of Expo for a streamlined development experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms.
- **Pre-configured Libraries**: Includes essential libraries such as React Navigation for routing, React Native Paper for UI components, and many more
- **Bottom Tab Navigator**: Comes with a pre-configured bottom tab navigator to facilitate easy screen transitions.
- **Sample Dummy Pages**: Five dummy pages are included by default to provide a starting point for your appâ€™s content and layout.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

## Usage of ESLint

ESLint is used in this project to ensure code quality and consistency. It helps in identifying and fixing problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to the defined coding standards. The ESLint configuration used in this project is based on the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which is a popular style guide for JavaScript development.

To run ESLint, use the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn lint
   ```

This will check the codebase for any linting issues based on the configured rules.
